Summary
This repository contains:

1) Resume Content (restricted) - my personal resume text/data
2) Repository Code and Structure (permitted) - everything else used to build and publish the resume

This repository uses RenderCV (a public tool) to build a resume from a YAML file.

1. Resume Content (All Rights Reserved)
The following are "Resume Content":

- The resume YAML content (text, data, phrasing, bullets, descriptions)
- Any generated outputs that contain that content (PDF, HTML, Markdown, images, etc.)
- Any other files that are clearly personal resume content

Resume Content is not licensed for reuse. All rights are reserved.

You may:

- View and download the Resume Content for evaluation purposes (for example hiring, reference, or recruiting)
- Fork this repository to propose changes back to me via pull request, but only to edit my Resume Content for my benefit

You may not:

- Copy, reuse, republish, redistribute, or sell the Resume Content (in whole or in part)
- Use the Resume Content to create or improve your own resume, portfolio, bio, or similar materials
- Train or fine-tune a model primarily on the Resume Content or use it as a template for generating substantially similar resume text

1. Repository Code and Structure (Permissive Use)
Everything in this repository that is not Resume Content is "Repository Code and Structure". This includes, for example:

- Build scripts, automation, CI/CD workflows, configuration, templates, tooling glue code
- Folder layout, repo structure, and documentation about how to build and publish
- Any helper code used to run RenderCV or generate outputs

You may:

- Fork, copy, modify, and reuse the Repository Code and Structure for any purpose, including building your own resume builder
- Publish your fork, including as a template or starter repository, as long as you do not include the Resume Content
- Distribute your modified versions of the Repository Code and Structure under your own terms

Condition:

- You must remove and replace all Resume Content with your own before publishing or redistributing a fork or derivative repository.

1. No Warranty
This repository is provided "AS IS", without warranties or conditions of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement.

2. Notes
RenderCV is a third-party tool and is subject to its own license and terms. This LICENSE does not grant any rights to RenderCV itself.
