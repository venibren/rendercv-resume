This repository uses RenderCV (a public tool) to build a resume from a YAML file.

Resume content
The information and text in the resume YAML and any generated outputs (PDF/HTML/Markdown/etc.) are my personal content and are not licensed for reuse.

You may:

- View and download the resume for evaluation (for example, hiring or reference)
- Fork this repo and make changes for the purpose of proposing edits back to me (pull requests)

You may not:

- Copy, reuse, republish, or redistribute the resume content (in whole or in part) as your own
- Use the resume content to create your own resume, portfolio, bio, or similar materials

Everything else
Any non-resume files in this repository (for example: build instructions, config, CI) may be reused unless a file says otherwise.

No warranty
This repository is provided "AS IS", without warranties or conditions of any kind.
